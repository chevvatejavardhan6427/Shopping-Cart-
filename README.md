🛒 Shopping Cart Program (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly **shopping cart program** written in Python.  
I built this project while learning Python from a tutorial, but I understood each and every step of the code.  
It helped me practice how **loops, lists, conditionals, and user input** work together.
